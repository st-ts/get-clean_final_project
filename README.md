# The project for the "Getting and cleaning data" course 
## Working with wearable computers dataset

The code for merging and modifying data is here.
In order to run it, you need to specify the folder where you have unzipped the data.
The ordering of the steps for the assignment was modified for convinience. The resulting code does the following:
1. Reads the data from the folder
2. Merges test data and train data
3. Adds names to the columns of the data
